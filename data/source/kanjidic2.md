# kanjidic2.zip

Contains a single XML file `kanjidic2.xml` with Kanji data.

Here is the overall file structure (detailed documentation is contained in the
file itself):

- `character`: root element for a Kanji character
	- `literal`: the character itself.
	- `codepoint`: codepoint of the character in various standards.
		- `cp_value` (+): codepoint for a particular standard identified by the `[cp_type]` attribute:
			- `jis208` - JIS X 0208-1997 - kuten coding (nn-nn)
			- `jis212` - JIS X 0212-1990 - kuten coding (nn-nn)
			- `jis213` - JIS X 0213-2000 - kuten coding (p-nn-nn)
			- `ucs` - Unicode 4.0 - hex coding (4 or 5 hexadecimal digits)
	- `radical`:
		- `rad_value` (+): 
			- The radical number, in the range 1 to 214. The particular classification type is stated in the `rad_type` attribute.
			- `[rad_type]`: The rad_type attribute states the type of radical classification:
				- `classical` - based on the system first used in the KangXi Zidian. The Shibano "JIS Kanwa Jiten" is used as the reference source.
				- `nelson_c` - as used in the Nelson "Modern Japanese-English Character Dictionary" (i.e. the Classic, not the New Nelson). This will only be used where Nelson reclassified the kanji.
	- `misc`:
		- `grade` (?): The kanji grade level. 1 through 6 indicates a Kyouiku kanji and the grade in which the kanji is taught in Japanese schools. 8 indicates it is one of the remaining Jouyou Kanji to be learned in junior high school. 9 indicates it is a Jinmeiyou (for use in names) kanji which in addition to the Jouyou kanji are approved  for use in family name registers and other official documents. 10 also indicates a Jinmeiyou kanji which is a variant of a Jouyou kanji.
		- `stroke_count` (+): The stroke count of the kanji, including the radical. If more than  one, the first is considered the accepted count, while subsequent ones  are common miscounts.
		- `variant` (*):
			- Either a cross-reference code to another kanji, usually regarded as a variant, or an alternative indexing code for the current kanji. The type of variant is given in the `[var_type]` attribute:
			- `jis208` - in JIS X 0208 - kuten coding
			- `jis212` - in JIS X 0212 - kuten coding
			- `jis213` - in JIS X 0213 - kuten coding
			- (most of the above relate to "shinjitai/kyuujitai" alternative character glyphs)
			- `deroo` - De Roo number - numeric
			- `njecd` - Halpern NJECD index number - numeric
			- `s_h` - The Kanji Dictionary (Spahn & Hadamitzky) - descriptor
			- `nelson_c` - "Classic" Nelson - numeric
			- `oneill` - Japanese Names (O'Neill) - numeric
			- `ucs` - Unicode codepoint - hex
		- `freq` (?): A frequency-of-use ranking. The 2,500 most-used characters have a ranking; those characters that lack this field are not ranked. The frequency is a number from 1 to 2,500 that expresses the relative frequency of occurrence of a character in modern Japanese. The discrimination between the less frequently used kanji is not strong. (Actually there are 2,501 kanji ranked as there was a tie.)
		- `rad_name` (*): When the kanji is itself a radical and has a name, this element contains the name (in hiragana.)
		- `jlpt` (?): The (former) Japanese Language Proficiency test level for this kanji. Values range from 1 (most advanced) to 4 (most elementary). This field  does not appear for kanji that were not required for any JLPT level. Note that the JLPT test levels changed in 2010, with a new 5-level system (N1 to N5) being introduced. No official kanji lists are available for the new levels. The new levels are regarded as being similar to the old levels except that the old level 2 is now divided between N2 and N3.
	- `dic_number` (?):
		- This element contains the index numbers and similar unstructured information such as page numbers in a number of published dictionaries, and instructional books on kanji.
		- `dic_ref` (+): Each dic_ref contains an index number. The particular dictionary, etc. is defined by the `[dr_type]` attribute:

They are in the form `nxnn.n`, e.g. 3k11.2, where the kanji has 3 strokes in the identifying radical, it is radical "k" in the SH classification system, there are 11 other strokes, and it is the 2nd kanji in the 3k11 sequence.
